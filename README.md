# Car Model Classification Using Deep Neural Networks

## Abstract
The future of car producer companies is moving towards innovative marketing strategies to better understand customer preferences through social media, utilizing image processing techniques on social posts. The identification of car brand and model preferences has driven the development of advanced processing techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deeper architectures. A key challenge lies in choosing state-of-the-art models when handling large, varied datasets. This project explores different deep neural network models, focusing on fine-tuned ResNet variants. ResNet-50 was chosen as the optimal model due to its performance in handling a large number of classes and methods to address class imbalance. The objective is to boost model accuracy for car model classification, minimize computational complexity, and effectively generalize the CompCars dataset. Results indicate that the ResNet-50 pipeline outperforms shallower networks, excelling in time, resource, and computational efficiency.

## Introduction
With the rise of social media, posts featuring cars have become widespread. Social media users frequently share their car brand/model preferences, turning this content into valuable data for car manufacturers. This has spurred the analysis of brand and model ownership to refine marketing strategies for key cities. Automated image processing techniques capable of extracting and verifying car make/model information in well-trained models facilitate more streamlined identification for marketing strategies.

The classification of car brands/models requires more complex architectures than standard image processing. This project utilizes ResNet-50, a deep neural network model, to train a system that increases car model recognition accuracy while reducing computational load compared to other models.
